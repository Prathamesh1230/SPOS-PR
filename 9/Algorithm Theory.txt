Best Fit Algorithm:
Purpose: To minimize memory wastage by placing a process in the smallest available block that is large enough to accommodate it.

Algorithm:
Input:

Number of memory blocks nBlocks and their sizes blockSizes[].
Number of processes nProcesses and their sizes processSizes[].
Initialize:

Create an allocation array allocation[] to store the block assigned to each process. Initialize all values in allocation[] to -1 (meaning not allocated).
For each process:

For each process i:
Initialize bestIdx = -1 to store the index of the best block for the process.
For each memory block j:
If blockSizes[j] >= processSizes[i] and:
If bestIdx == -1 or blockSizes[j] < blockSizes[bestIdx] (i.e., the current block is the smallest one that can fit the process):
Set bestIdx = j.
If bestIdx != -1 (i.e., a suitable block is found):
Allocate process i to block bestIdx (allocation[i] = bestIdx).
Reduce the size of blockSizes[bestIdx] by processSizes[i] (remaining memory in the block).
Output:

Print the allocation results, displaying the process number, process size, and the block allocated.











Worst Fit Algorithm:
Purpose: To maximize remaining space in the largest available block by placing the process in the biggest block that can accommodate it.

Algorithm:
Input:

Number of memory blocks nBlocks and their sizes blockSizes[].
Number of processes nProcesses and their sizes processSizes[].
Initialize:

Create an allocation array allocation[] to store the block assigned to each process. Initialize all values in allocation[] to -1 (meaning not allocated).
For each process:

For each process i:
Initialize worstIdx = -1 to store the index of the worst block for the process.
For each memory block j:
If blockSizes[j] >= processSizes[i] and:
If worstIdx == -1 or blockSizes[j] > blockSizes[worstIdx] (i.e., the current block is the largest one that can fit the process):
Set worstIdx = j.
If worstIdx != -1 (i.e., a suitable block is found):
Allocate process i to block worstIdx (allocation[i] = worstIdx).
Reduce the size of blockSizes[worstIdx] by processSizes[i] (remaining memory in the block).
Output:

Print the allocation results, displaying the process number, process size, and the block allocated.



















Best Fit Memory Allocation:
Goal: Minimize wasted space by finding the smallest block that is big enough for the process.
How it works:
The algorithm traverses the list of available memory blocks and selects the smallest block that is capable of fitting the process.
It aims to leave the smallest leftover space possible in the block.
Worst Fit Memory Allocation:
Goal: Maximize the remaining space in the largest block by allocating the process to the biggest available block.
How it works:
The algorithm selects the largest block that is big enough for the process.
The idea is that by leaving the largest remaining space in the biggest block, there may be more chances for larger processes to fit later.
Comparison of Best Fit and Worst Fit:
Best Fit typically results in smaller leftover spaces but can lead to fragmentation over time as smaller chunks of memory are created.
Worst Fit can create larger leftover spaces, which may help accommodate large processes, but can lead to inefficient use of memory due to larger unused portions in blocks.
