The Shortest Job First (SJF) Scheduling Algorithm works as follows:

Input:

The number of processes and their respective burst times (the time each process needs to execute).
Sorting:

The processes are sorted in increasing order of their burst time, so that the shortest job (process) is executed first.
Execution:

The processes are executed in order of their burst time, starting from the shortest.
After each process completes, the next shortest job is selected for execution.
Calculations:

Waiting Time: The time a process spends waiting in the ready queue before it starts executing. It is calculated as the sum of burst times of all the previous processes.
Turnaround Time: The total time a process takes to complete, from arrival to completion. It is the sum of the waiting time and the burst time of the process.
Output:

The program displays the burst time, waiting time, and turnaround time for each process, along with the average waiting time and average turnaround time for all processes.





Shortest Job First (SJF) is a CPU scheduling algorithm that selects the process with the shortest burst time (or execution time) for execution first. It is a non-preemptive scheduling algorithm, meaning once a process starts executing, it is not interrupted until it finishes. The goal of SJF is to minimize the average waiting time by prioritizing shorter tasks.

Key Points:
Non-Preemptive: Once a process starts executing, it will run to completion without being interrupted.
Shortest Burst Time First: The process with the shortest burst time (CPU time) is selected first for execution.
Optimal for Minimizing Average Waiting Time: SJF is known to minimize the average waiting time when compared to other scheduling algorithms like FCFS (First-Come-First-Served).
Starvation: One downside of SJF is the possibility of starvation, where longer processes may never get executed if shorter processes keep arriving.
