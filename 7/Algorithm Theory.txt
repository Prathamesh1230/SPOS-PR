1. Algorithm for First Fit:

Iterate through each process.
For each process, iterate over the memory blocks and find the first block that is large enough.
If a suitable block is found, allocate the process to that block and reduce the block size.
Repeat the process until all processes are allocated or no suitable block is found.


1. First Fit Memory Allocation
The First Fit algorithm allocates the first available memory block that is large enough to fit the process. It starts from the first block of memory and continues searching for a block that can accommodate the process. Once a suitable block is found, the process is allocated to it, and the remaining memory in that block is adjusted accordingly.

Advantages:
Simple and easy to implement.
Generally fast, especially when memory blocks are arranged in a list.
Disadvantages:
Can lead to memory fragmentation over time, especially if many small blocks are allocated.
Might not always result in the most efficient memory usage.







2. Algorithm for Best Fit:

Iterate through each process.
For each process, find the smallest memory block that can accommodate the process size.
Allocate the process to the chosen block and reduce the block size.
If no suitable block is found, the process remains unallocated.


2. Best Fit Memory Allocation
The Best Fit algorithm tries to find the block that most closely fits the size of the process. It scans all the blocks to find the one with the smallest size that can still accommodate the process. This aims to minimize wasted memory but might lead to more fragmentation in the long run.

Advantages:
Minimizes unused memory in blocks, potentially reducing fragmentation.
Disadvantages:
More time-consuming than First Fit because it requires searching through all available blocks for each process.
Can leave small fragments of memory scattered across the system.
